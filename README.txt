All code used to create the training database and machine learning algorithm for the discrimination of three locomotion activities, and for calculating their success in discriminating novel recordings.

Code is ordered in order it should be executed. 

It is assumed raw accelerometer data is available, and that 10 starting times for each of the three activites are saved onto a .csv file.
